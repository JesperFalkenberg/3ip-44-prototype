# About
* This project was made during a cross-disciplinary uni course to show non-coders a bit about code, while I also learned about their disciplines - it is not the highest standard of anything, and should be checked through for security issues if you plan to use this as guidance for some reason

# Setup
* Use most recent version of Node
* Run `npm install` in the folder containing `package.json` (usually the root of the project)
* To build: `npm run build` (always build before you start)
* To start: `npm run start` (or `npm run start:dev` for watchmode while developing)

# The frontend
* Webpage with components run on `localhost:3000`
* Data lists from repository are found on `/api/clothing` appended with their respecitve names `/avgList`, `/productList` and `/stepList`
